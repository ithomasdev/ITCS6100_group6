### Business Objective/Problem
How can HBO maximize profits when releasing new movies or tv shows?

### Research Objectives and Question(s)
Movies and TV shows are the main source of income for HBO Max. 
Thus, we want to predict/correlate different metrics in relation to imdb/tmdb ratings.

For example:
- What is the relationship between runtime and how the movie/show performed?
- What significance does the genre have in relation to its popularity? Does the release year also affect this relationship?
