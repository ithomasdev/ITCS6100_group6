## Communcation

The platform we are using to communicate the project related work is Slack. Together we came up with the idea of working with a Crossfit Athletes dataset that contains information on athlete demographics like age, gender, training experience as well as their performance metrics such as time, weight lifted, and repetitions completed.

### Dataset

A huge set of data from competitions and events around the world has been put together to learn more about the traits and abilities of CrossFit athletes. This set of data includes information about the athlete's age, gender, and training experience, as well as their time, weight lifted, and number of repetitions. The dataset includes many different CrossFit events and competitions, giving a lot of information about how athletes did in different situations.

By looking at the data, researchers can find trends and patterns that may be linked to higher levels of performance, such as age, gender, training volume, and exercise choice. This information can be used to make training plans for CrossFit athletes that are based on facts and improve their physical skills while lowering the risk of injury.

This dataset contains complete training data of different athletes collected from different competitions and events around the world including the country they are from, their previous training and experience data. It has 423006 rows, 27 feature columns.
  
### Business Objective/Problem
We can create an analytics and insights service tailored to CrossFit competitors, trainers, and facilities. Athlete dataset data can shed light on current CrossFit trends, performance standards, and competitive landscape. Using this service, CrossFitters can learn about what's new in the field and use that knowledge to improve their own workouts, instruct others, or run a successful gym.


### Research Objectives and Question(s)
1.	Identifying the patterns in athlete performance
2.	Identifying the most successful countries and regions 
3.	Comparing male and female athlete performances
4.	Predicting the likelihood of an athlete making it to the CrossFit Games
5.	Predicting the winner of individual events
6.	Predicting the winner based on how long theyâ€™ve been trained and their diet information.
