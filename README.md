https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgoenrique/hbo-max-movies-and-tv-shows

- titles.csv
  - this table contains information regarding ratings, genre, runtime, etc
- credits.csv
  - this table contains information regarding actors/actresses, characters, directors, etc
  
### Business Objective/Problem
How can HBO maximize profits when releasing new movies or tv shows?

### Research Objectives and Question(s)
HBO Max is a premium streaming service that allows users to stream popular movies and tv shows for a month or yearly fee. They generate revenue based on the interest level and recurring subscriptions. The ratings of the movies and shows on their platform have a direct relationship with how they perform as a corporation. Thus, we want to predict/correlate different "success" metrics in relation to imdb/tmdb ratings.

For example:
- What is the relationship between runtime and how the movie/show performed?
- What significance does the genre have in relation to its popularity? Does the release year also affect this relationship?

## Option 2

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivd24coder/fifa-world-cup-dataset

This dataset contains four seperate tables:
- goals.csv
  - this table contains information regarding scoring events. This includes the minute a goal was scored, who scored the goal, and the score of both teams
- team.csv
  - this table contains data regarding players such as name, age, position, etc
- attendance.csv
  - this table contains data regarding the date of the game, stadium, referee, stage, etc
- match.csv
  - this table contains data regarding score, round, teams, etc
  
### Business Objective/Problem
What are the best times to display commercials or advertisements?

### Research Objectives and Question(s)
Outside of ticket sales, advertisement revenue is one of the main methods for countries and broadcasting companies to make money during the world cup.
Thus, we want to measure/predict the points of the match that will be have the least amount of goals scored or action events. These points would be the most ideal for displaying advertisements.

For example:
- When have goals typically been scored in the past decade?
- Does stadium/environment have any affect on when goals are scored?
- Does the attendance of the match have any affect on how many goals are scored or shots taken?
